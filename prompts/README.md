# Prompts Organization - Clean Architecture Progress

## 📊 **CURRENT STATUS OVERVIEW**

### **Progress Summary:**
- **2025-07-10_01_infrastructure_base_testing.md:** ✅ COMPLETED (moved to done/) - infrastructure, health endpoint, tests, code quality
- **2025-07-10_02_development_complete_tdd.md:** ⚠️ PARTIAL (only health endpoint, skeleton, health/log/db tests, no real features)
- **2025-07-10_05_further_development_advanced.md:** 0% (backlog)
- **2025-07-10_06_deployment_infrastructure_strategy.md:** 0% (backlog)

**Total Progress:** Basic infrastructure and health endpoint are implemented, but real domain logic and features are not.

## 🎯 **Prompt File Organization:**

### **2025-07-10_01_infrastructure_base_testing.md** ✅ COMPLETED
- **Location:** `prompts/done/`
- **Focus:** Docker, health endpoint, tests, code quality
- **Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - All infrastructure features implemented

### **2025-07-10_02_development_complete_tdd.md** ⚠️ PARTIAL
- **Location:** `prompts/in_progress/`
- **Focus:** Clean architecture skeleton, health endpoint, basic tests
- **Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL (no real domain entities, use-cases, REST API, advanced logic)

### **2025-07-10_05_further_development_advanced.md** (BACKLOG)
- **Location:** `prompts/backlog/`
- **Focus:** Advanced features, enterprise architecture
- **Status:** Backlog

### **2025-07-10_06_deployment_infrastructure_strategy.md** (BACKLOG)
- **Location:** `prompts/backlog/`
- **Focus:** Deployment, infrastructure strategy
- **Status:** Backlog

## 🎯 **TDD Approach for Prompts:**

### **TDD Cycle:**
1. **Write Test First** (Red) - Test fails
2. **Make Test Pass** (Green) - Minimal implementation
3. **Refactor** - Improve code quality
4. **Document** - Update documentation

## ✅ **What is done (Infrastructure):**
- Basic clean architecture skeleton structure
- Health endpoint and health tests
- Tests for health/log/db
- Code quality tools
- Docker environment
- All infrastructure features implemented and tested

## ⚠️ **What is NOT done:**
- Real domain entities and business logic
- REST API for domain entities
- Advanced use-cases and services
- Advanced tests (BDD, feature, integration)
- Advanced security, validation, CQRS, Event Sourcing, GraphQL
- Real user functionality

---

## 📋 **NEXT STEPS:**
- Implement domain entities and business logic
- Implement REST API for domain entities
- Add advanced use-cases and services
- Add advanced tests
- Implement advanced security, validation, CQRS, Event Sourcing, GraphQL
- Add user and admin functionality

## Note
2025-07-10_02_development_complete_tdd.md is only partially done: only the skeleton and health check exist, but there is no real domain logic, entities, or complete features. The next steps are to implement real business requirements and APIs.
