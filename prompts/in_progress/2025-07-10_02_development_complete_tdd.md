# Development - Fruits and Vegetables Service Implementation

‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPORTANT**: This prompt must strictly follow all execution rules defined in [`rules.md`](./rules.md).  
No assumptions, no hallucinations, no duplication of prompt 2 logic, and strict adherence to KISS/DRY/YAGNI/SOLID principles is required.

## üéØ Goal from README.md
Build a service that:
- Processes `request.json` and creates separate collections for Fruits and Vegetables
- Each collection has `add()`, `remove()`, `list()` methods
- Units stored as grams
- Store collections in database
- Provide API endpoints to query and add items
- Optional: unit conversion (kg/g), search functionality
