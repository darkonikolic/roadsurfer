**Estimated time:** 1 hour
- [#core] Upgrade Symfony from 6.0 to latest LTS (7.0) while preserving all functionality
- [#core] Create `ProductDTO` with properties (id, name, type, quantity, unit)
- [#core] Create `ProductListDTO` to hold array of ProductDTOs
- [#core] Create `FruitDTO` extending ProductDTO with fruit-specific validation
- [#core] Create `FruitListDTO` to hold array of FruitDTOs
- [#core] Create `VegetableDTO` extending ProductDTO with vegetable-specific validation
- [#core] Create `VegetableListDTO` to hold array of VegetableDTOs
- [#core] Write unit tests for all DTOs with validation

#### **Phase 2: JSON Processing Services (TDD First) [#core]**
**Goal:** Process incoming JSON data and convert units from kilograms to grams
**Estimated time:** 1.5 hours
- [#core] Create `JsonToProductListService` that takes JSON string and produces valid `ProductListDTO`
- [#core] Create `UnitConversionService` that converts all product units from kilograms to grams
- [#core] Create `ProductSplitterService` that splits `ProductListDTO` into `FruitListDTO` and `VegetableListDTO` based on type
- [#core] Ensure `ProductListDTO` is not stored in database (only used for processing)
- [#core] Write comprehensive unit tests for all services with 100% test coverage
- [#core] Validate JSON payload structure and ensure every item in array is valid before processing

#### **Phase 3: Database Entities and Persistence (TDD First) [#core]**
**Goal:** Create database schema and persistence layer for fruits and vegetables
**Estimated time:** 1 hour
- [#core] Create `Fruit` entity with properties (id, name, quantity in grams, created_at, updated_at)
- [#core] Create `Vegetable` entity with properties (id, name, quantity in grams, created_at, updated_at)
- [#core] Create database migrations for separate fruits and vegetables tables
- [#core] Create `FruitRepository` with search methods
- [#core] Create `VegetableRepository` with search methods
- [#core] Write integration tests for entities and repositories

#### **Phase 4: Caching Infrastructure (TDD First) [#optional]**
**Goal:** Implement Redis caching for improved performance on search operations
**Estimated time:** 0.5 hours
- [#optional] Configure Redis for caching search results
- [#optional] Create `FruitCacheService` for caching fruit search results
- [#optional] Create `VegetableCacheService` for caching vegetable search results
- [#optional] Implement cache invalidation on insert/update operations
- [#optional] Write tests for caching functionality

#### **Phase 5: Application Services (TDD First) [#core]**

3. **Refactor** - Improve code quality
4. **Document** - Update API documentation
